# Data types for IMAGE attributes

[BioSamples](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples) takes sample records with a set of attributes. Each attribute has a name and a value. It can also have 'Units', or a 'Term Source' and a 'Term Source ID'. The Term Source and ID allow us to refer to entries in other databases or ontologies. This is fully described on the [BioSamples help pages](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/help/st_scd.html). The following section describes the expectations for each data type within IMAGE.

### date

Dates should be reported in an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format,  YYYY-MM-DD for dates or YYYY-MM for months. To ensure clarity, the format must be reported as the 'units'.

### NCBI taxon ID

A species name and identifier from the [NCBI Taxonomy database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy). For example, [human](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/9606) would be described in the term with value of 'Homo sapiens', term source as 'NCBI Taxonomy' and term source ID as 9606.

### number

A number, with units specified. BioSamples recommends that units are given without abbreviations. Terms defined in the [UO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uo) are encouraged to be used. For example, a birth weight could have a value of 1.3 and the units specified as '[kilogram](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uo/terms?short_form=UO_0000009)' .

### text

Text, using US English spellings.

### URI

A URI,  such as 'http://www.imageh2020.eu//'. Depending on the context, http, ftp, mailto links may be appropriate. Examples:

 * ftp, ftp://ftp.image.ebi.ac.uk/ftp/README
 * http,  http://www.imageh2020.eu/
 * mailto, mailto:bob@example.org

### DOI

Digital Object Identifier (DOI) can unambiguously point to one publication, which can be resolved [here](http://www.doi.org/).

### ontology term

A reference to an ontology term. The attribute value should be the term label. The term source should be the ontology used, and the term source ID should be an ID from that ontology. For example, cerebral cortex could be  described with an ontology term from 'UBERON' with ontology ID of 'UBERON:0000956' and the attribute value is 'cerebral cortex'. Though in the experiment submission, direct links to ontologies cannot be submitted as attributes. The use of ontology terms is still encouraged by setting the attribute value to exactly match the term name in the ontology. 

### sample

Samples can be referred to in two ways. If the sample you need to reference is in the submission, use the sample name. If the sample was already submitted, use the BioSample ID (e.g. SAMEA2821491).
